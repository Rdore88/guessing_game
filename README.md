#Read me for numbers guessing game project
Normal Mode: This program is a number guessing game were the computer will pick a number
 from 1-100 and give you hints to help you guess it correctly but you only have
 5 tries before you lose. If you pick the same number twice it will make fun of
 you!

 Hard Mode: This program is the same as above but the rand method is not used
 and it will make fun of you if your choices get worse.
